## Environment Setup

### Use scripts

1. double click the start.sh file. This will download, build and run both the back-end and front-end.
2. To stop, press CTRL-C in the terminal that opened when you started the start.sh script, or close the terminal.
3. double click the stop.sh script. This will stop the back-end services.

If for some reason start.sh is not working it could be because a container or volume got corrupted.

Please run the reset.sh script and once that has finished running you can run start.sh again.


### Use docker compose
- Run the following command in the IAS-project folder to start all backend services
  ```sh
  # If this is the first time running this command it will take some time while the docker images are downloaded.
  # Future uses will be very fast.
  $ docker compose up
  ```


- To start a development version of the front end, please input the following commands.
  ```sh
  $ cd react
  
  # this will install all modules and could take some time
  $ npm install 
  
  # this will build and serve the project.
  $ npm start 
  ```
